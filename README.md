Centralized data security monitoring

Informant is a novel approach to information security, in that, rather than try to cleverly monitor external connections,
or apply complex data access policies, Informant is designed to be installed on every computer within an organization to 
quietly monitor how all data is being used. Utilizing driver level access, all storage activity that occurs on a computer 
is securely intercepted, and metadata about the activity is logged. Each time data is created, copied, modified, read or
deleted, Informant logs important information about the operating system, process, network, computer, date, file, and
user. This comprehensive logging produces a very clear record of how a user is utilizing the information on a computer, 
and what the intentions of that user might be. Whether users are simply performing normal work functions, or are trying 
to subvert access control policies, the Informant system is fully capable of keeping records of real-time data interactions
on every computer within an organization.
